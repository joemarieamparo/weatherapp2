# Weather application

## Setup
In the application build.gradle, replace `API_KEY` value with a valid key

## Things to improve
1. Improve UI, sadly I am not good with creating my own design. I need app designer for better UI/UX.
2. Database. Since api refreshes in time interval, should fetch from database if:
    2.1. Data is available
    2.2. If it is with the refresh interval from database.
3. Improve unit test coverage.
